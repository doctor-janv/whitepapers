# Doctor-JanV's referenceable whitepapers, notes, and other documents

This is a place where I store version controlled copies of documents I create,
with the intent of sharing them in a referenceable fashion.

## Referencing a document in here:

Different version of a document is generally within a respective folder.

For example, ChiTech-LBS-TheoryManual, reference as:
```
Vermaak J., "Whitepaper: The Linear Boltzmann Solver - a Discrete Ordinates method solver -  Theory Manual",
August 2022,
https://github.com/doctor-janv/whitepapers/ChiTech-LBS-TheoryManual/ChiTech-LBS-TheoryManual_v_1_12.pdf
```
